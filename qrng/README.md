# [Quantum random number generators with entanglement for public randomness testing](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-56706-2)
<br>
<br>

## SUMMARY
<br>
a new protocol<br> 
which takes an advantage from the ability to exponentially reduce the local computational resources<br> 
by the splitting of the final binary random sequence into arbitrarily many sequence parts of equal length<br> 
and sharing exactly the same statistical properties<br> 
due to the quantum arbitrariness of the correlated/anticorrelated entangled states involved<br>
