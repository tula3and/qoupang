- Summary
  - A new protocol which takes an advantage from the ability to exponentially reduce the local computational resources
  - By the splitting of the final binary random sequence into arbitrarily many sequence parts of equal length and sharing exactly the same statistical properties
  - Due to the quantum arbitrariness of the correlated/anticorrelated entangled states involved
